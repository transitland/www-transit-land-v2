Transitland brings together many sources of transit data to build a directory of operators and feeds that can be edited by transit enthusiasts and developers.

<b-message type="is-warning" has-icon>

  This documentation site primarily describes Transitland v2. Some components of Transitland v1 are deprecated but still active, including the [Transitland v1 Datastore API](/documentation/datastore/).

## Comparing the APIs

Transitland v1 and v2 provide a range of APIs. All are powered by the same underlying database cluster. Each has a different set of capabilities and constraints:

| API                                                            | Status           | Root Endpoint                        | API Key Required                        | Cost                    | Uses                                                                                                                             |
