title: 'Transitland Dispatcher is Deprecated'
---

You are probably finding this page because you followed a link to the Transitland Dispatcher.

Dispatcher was our "power user" interface for Transitland v1. It combined both administrative controls (available just to authorized staffers) with advanced stats and visualizations (available to all). Transitland Dispatcher is no longer maintained, although [its source code is still available on GitHub](https://github.com/transitland/dispatcher)

Now in [Transitland v2](/documentation/), all of the stats and visualizations are available on this public website. Please use the menus above and below to explore.
